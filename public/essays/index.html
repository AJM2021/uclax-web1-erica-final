        <h1>Final Project Homework</h1>
        <h2>01. Explain the difference between HTML, CSS and JS.</h2>
        <p>HTML is a programming language that provides the basic structure of websites, which can be enhanced and modified by other technologies like CSS and Javascript. HTML is at the heart of every webpage, even complex sites. Understanding HTML is a key skipp for web professionals and the beginning point for people learning to create content for the web. HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language, referring to the tags it uses to identify different types of content and the purposes they serve on webpages (“Markup language”).</p>
        <p>CSS is a technology used to control overall presentation, formatting, and layout. CSS is an acronym for “Cascading Style Sheets.” It dictates how the HTML elements of a website should appear on a page. While HTML provides the raw language needed to structure content on a page, CSS helps to style the content to appear the way the designer wishes it to. The languages are separate to ensure websites are built correctly (HTML) before they are formatted (CSS).</p>
        <p>JavaScript is used to control the behavior of different items on the page. It is a more complicated and more recent language than HTML or CSS. It is used on almost every site for more powerful and complete functionality. JavaScript can be used to modify page content and make it behave in response to a user’s action. Common uses include confirmation boxes, calls-to-action, an dadding new identities to existing information. Javascript increases the interactivity of a site.</p>

        <h2>02. What are Single Page Apps (SPAs)? How do they differ from traditional multi-page websites?</h2>
        <p>A single page app (SPA) is a web application that interacts with users dynamically by drawing new data from the web server instead of loading entire web pages into the browser. The hope of this kind of application is to make it as fast as possible and to make transitions feel seamless. </p>
        <p>SPAs load all needed HTML, JS and CSS in a single page load, or add resources as needed in response to user actions.</p> 
        <p>Other ways they are different from regular websites include:</p>
        <ol>They present a challenge in terms of search engine optimization because not all content is loaded to the page.</ol>
        <ol>Because they are by definition a single page, users are not able to effectively use their forward or back buttons to navigate.</ol>
        <ol>Traditional analytics tools have trouble tracking the user’s activity on these pages.</ol>
