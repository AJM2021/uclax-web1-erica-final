        <h1>Final Project Homework</h1>
        <h2>01. Explain the difference between HTML, CSS and JS.</h2>
        <p>HTML is a programming language that provides the basic structure of websites, which can be enhanced and modified by other technologies like CSS and Javascript. HTML is at the heart of every webpage, even complex sites. Understanding HTML is a key skipp for web professionals and the beginning point for people learning to create content for the web. HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language, referring to the tags it uses to identify different types of content and the purposes they serve on webpages (“Markup language”).</p>
        <p>CSS is a technology used to control overall presentation, formatting, and layout. CSS is an acronym for “Cascading Style Sheets.” It dictates how the HTML elements of a website should appear on a page. While HTML provides the raw language needed to structure content on a page, CSS helps to style the content to appear the way the designer wishes it to. The languages are separate to ensure websites are built correctly (HTML) before they are formatted (CSS).</p>
        <p>JavaScript is used to control the behavior of different items on the page. It is a more complicated and more recent language than HTML or CSS. It is used on almost every site for more powerful and complete functionality. JavaScript can be used to modify page content and make it behave in response to a user’s action. Common uses include confirmation boxes, calls-to-action, an dadding new identities to existing information. Javascript increases the interactivity of a site.</p>

        <h2>02. What are Single Page Apps (SPAs)? How do they differ from traditional multi-page websites?</h2>
        <p>A single page app (SPA) is a web application that interacts with users dynamically by drawing new data from the web server instead of loading entire web pages into the browser. The hope of this kind of application is to make it as fast as possible and to make transitions feel seamless. </p>
        <p>SPAs load all needed HTML, JS and CSS in a single page load, or add resources as needed in response to user actions.</p> 
        <p>Other ways they are different from regular websites include:</p>
        <ol>They present a challenge in terms of search engine optimization because not all content is loaded to the page.</ol>
        <ol>Because they are by definition a single page, users are not able to effectively use their forward or back buttons to navigate.</ol>
        <ol>Traditional analytics tools have trouble tracking the user’s activity on these pages.</ol>

        <h2>03. What is the difference between Web Designer, Front End Developer and Back End Developer?</h2>
        <p>Web designers focus on the appearance or design of a website or application. They have studied graphic design, color theory, and how information should flow for users. Some aspects of web design touch on user experience, such as information flow or hierarchy. Some of the tools that we designers use include Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, or other tools to wire frame sites. Web designers should also know HTML, CSS, and JS.</p>
        <p>Web developers, on the other hand, focus on the function of a website or application. Front end developers work on functionality for the part of a site or app that you see. They use HTML, CSS, and JS skills to develop and work closely with web designers. Back end developers work on the system or database behind a site, and use programming languages or frameworks like Ruby on Rails or Python.</p>

            <h2>04. Distinguish the difference between Site Relative, Document Relative, and Absolute Paths.</h2>
            <p>Absolute paths always include the http://www., whereas relative links point to a specific file (document relative) or a file path. A relative link takes a user to a location on the current site. Relative links are used to link to files (document relative) or pages (relative) within your site. Absolute paths lead to a location on another website.</p>
            <p>Relative paths include:</p>
            <p><ol>Index.html</ol></p>
            <p><ol>/graphics/image.png</ol></p>
            <p><ol>/help/articles/how-do-i-set-up-a-webpage.html</ol></p>
            <p>Absolute paths include:</p>
            <p><ol>http://www.mysite.com</ol></p>
            <p><ol>http://www.mysite.com/graphics/image.png </ol></p>
            <h2>Final Project Explanation</h2>
            <p>My final project will be to create a website for my portfolio and freelance services. The client will be me. The purpose of the website will be:</p>
            <p><ol>To demonstrate my accomplishments through my portfolio and</ol></p>
            <p><ol>To list my available freelance services and offer contact info/availability for projects</ol></p>
            <p><ol>To create a professional presence for myself as a freelance project manager and/or marketing manager online</ol></p>
            <p>I chose this subject because it is a real need of mine at the moment, and it is something I would like to create myself. Rather than asking a third party to create the site for me, I would like to demonstrate that I have the skills necessary to be able to do it on my own. I am looking forward to taking what we do for the class project a step further if I can - by finding resources online that I can repurpose - to make the site a little bit unique.</p>
            <h2>05. What does it mean for a company to be Agile? What is the purpose of using Agile and what are its pros and cons?</h2>
            <p>An agile company is one that can quickly adapt to market changes. The company has to be fast-moving and flexible, be able to respond quickly to unexpected challenges, be a change leader, listen to customer feedback, have a competitive advantage, and utilize a flat organizational structure for rapid communication.</p>
            <p>The purpose of using agile is to be able to reinvent quickly for continued success. An agile business can make decisions quickly and implement change as a result.</p>
            <p>The pros of agile are flexibility, quick feedback and fewer defective products. The cons of Agile include lack of documentation, scope creep, extended time on projects and lack of predictability.</p>
            <h2>06. Define the following roles: Project Manager, Business Analyst, Scrum Master, UX designer, Web Developer/Engineer, Quality Assurance Tester, and DevOps.</h2>
            <p>Project Manager: Project Managers lead on planning, executing, monitoring, controlling, and closing projects. They are responsible for the project scope, team, resources, and the overall success of the project.</p>
            <p>Business Analyst: Business Analysts bridge the gap between IT and the business by using analytics to assess processes, determine requirements and deliver recommendations and reports to executives and stakeholders.</p>
            <p>Scrum Master: Scrum Masters are responsible for making sure there is a “scrum” process over the course of the project. They ensure the scrum framework and facilitate the process for the organization, product owner and team. Scrum is a framework that allows teams to work on complicated projects by approaching problems adaptively.</p>
            <p>UX Designer: The UX Designer is responsible for designing and ensuring a high quality user experience. User experience is made up of all the interactions a person has with a brand, company, or organization, including interactions with software, a website, a call center, etc.</p>
            <p>Web Developer/Engineer: Front end web developers work on functionality for the part of a site or app that you see. They use HTML, CSS, and JS skills to develop and work closely with web designers. Back end developers work on the system or database behind a site, and use programming languages or frameworks like Ruby on Rails or Python.</p>
            <p>Quality Assurance Tester: A QA Tester is responsible for checking new software products for defects or issues. QA testers run various tests on the new software to ensure it meets all standards and guidelines and is ready to be marketed to consumers.</p>
            <p>DevOps: DevOps is the practice of operations and development engineers working together in the service lifecycle, from design through the development process to production support.</p>
            <h2>07. What is the difference between jpg, gif, png and SVG images?</h2>
            <ol>jpg: JPG or JPEG stands for Joint Photographic Experts Group. A jpg is optimized for photographs. They work with compressing color so are great for photos and complex digital images. JPGs are “lossy raster” files, so they lose a small amount of information everytime the file is saved. A high quality jpg is suitable for print.</ol>
            <ol>gif: GIF stands for Graphics Interchange Format. This is a bitmap format and supports up to 8 bits per pixel which limits the color palette to 256. This means gifs are not good for photos and these days are mostly used for simple animated memes.</ol>
            <ol>png: PNG stands for Portable Network Graphic. PNGs were designed for use on the web and are the most commonly used image compression format on the internet. They are not for printing professional images. PNGs are raster graphics that work well with line art images fnd photos for websites but can result in large file sizes. PNGs also offer alpha transparency which means each individual pixel has its own level of opacity. There are two types of PNGs: PNG-8 (8 bits per pixel) and PNG-24 (24 bits per pixel).</ol>
            <ol>SVG: SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics. SVGs are vector graphics, meaning they can scale truly to any size. They support animation and their behaviors are defined in XML files so they can be searched, indexed, scripted, and compressed. Vector graphics are good for logos and line art because they can be infinitely resized without losing quality or increasing in size. SVGs are best when creating icons and line art for high resolution displays.</ol>
            <h2>08. What are testing environments? What is the difference between Local, Dev, QA and Production?</h2>
            <p>Testing environments are servers that allow you to run the test cases you have defined. The test environment includes more than just setting up a server; it includes hardware and network configuration.</p>
            <p>A local testing environment is a place where you can set up a copy of your website that will still function like the real thing but is just on a personal server and local folders. A Dev environment is a dedicated environment for development of a site. A QA environment is a dedicated environment for testing. A Production environment is a dedicated environment for production of the site.</p>
            <h2>09. Function vs Form: When are web images considered part of the content (HTML) as opposed to part of the appearance (CSS)?</h2>
            <p>Use HTML when:</p>
            <ol>The image is part of the content, such as a logo or diagram</ol>
            <ol>You rely on browser scaling to render an image in proportion to text size</ol>
            <ol>To improve performance of animations over a background</ol>
            <p>Use CSS when:</p>
            <ol>The image is not part of the content (it is background)</ol>
            <ol>If you intend to have people print your page and do not want the image included by default</ol>
            <ol>You want to improve download times</ol>
            <ol>You need only a portion of the image to be visible</ol>
            <ol>To stretch a background image to fill its entire window</ol>
            <h2>10. What is considered the right size for an image or video asset?</h2>
            <ol>Images that span the entire width of the browser should be 2500 px.</ol>
            <ol>For smaller slideshows that don't take up the entire width, images can be scaled down to 2000px or 1800px.</ol>
            <ol>Thumbnails that will enlarge should be 1500px.</ol>
            <ol>Portrait images should have a max hegith of 1200px and be scaled accordingly.</ol>
            <ol>Static images should be scaled according to other content on the page.</ol>
            <ol>Videos should be less than 2MB in size.</ol>
            <h2>11. What is the difference between ID's, Classes and Tags? How does Specificity play a role in the selection of HTML elements (both in CSS and JS)</h2>
            <p>The difference between an ID and a Class is that "ID" is unique in a page and can only apply to at most one element, while "class" can apply to multiple elements. A tag in HTML is an inline element that defines a property. </p>
            <p>Specificity is the means by which browsers decide with CSS property values are the most relevant to an element and will be applied. Specificity is based on matching rules which are composed in different kinds of selectors.</p>
            <h2>12. Why is Web Accessibility important?</h2>
            <p>Web accessibility is important because by making a website accessible, you are ensuring that all potential users, including people with disabilities, have a good user experience and are able to easily access information. Implementing accessibility best practices also improves the usability of the site for all users. Finally, it ensures compliance with web and governmental guidelines.</p>
            <h2>13. What is a CSS Preprocessor? What are some examples? In React, what are styled components? How do Styled Components violate separation of concerns?</h2>
            <p>A CSS Preprocessor is a program that allows you to generate CSS from the preprocessor's own unique syntax. Most CSS preprocessors will add some features that don't exist in pure CSS, such as mixin, nesting selector, inheritance selector, etc. Some examples are Sass, LESS, and Stylus.</p>
            <p>In React, styled-components utilizes tagged templates to style your components. It removes the mapping between components and styles, meaning that when defining your styles, you're actually creating a normal React component with styles attached. </p>
            <p>Separation of concerns is about each compoentnt being its own concern and containing all the logic, styles, etc. needed. Styled-components adds the style to the individual component thus violating the separation of concerns.</p>
            <h2>14. What is the difference between Web Hosts, Domains, and FTP?</h2>
            <p>A web host is when a hosting provider allocates space on a web server for a website to store its files. A web domain is an actual presence on the Internet, such as a web page. Specifically, a web domain name is a substitute that replaces the IP address. FTP stands for File Transfer Protocol and is a way of transferring files. A computer can be an FTP host or server to offer FTP access. There are public FTP servers that can be used for transferring files.</p>
            <h2>15. What is a Package Manager (e.g. NPM, Composer)? How does it play a role in software development?</h2>
            <p>They help you manage dependencies on projects. They allow you to not reinvent the wheel. These are often tested packages. Packages are fulfilled on a remote server, to be used in app development. </p>
